Dear Customer,

We noticed that you may have experienced a problem yesterday in creating new databases on your CloudBees account, as identified below. We have looked into the issue and corrected it. Any databases you created yesterday should now be operational and able to be used with applications or a desktop client.

Account(s): ${accounts}
Database(s): ${databases}

Please note that this problem did not result in any data loss or problems with existing databases, but prevented the creation of new databases for a small time window.

We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate you using CloudBees. Please contact us on http://support.cloudbees.com if you have further issues or need help.

Sincerely,

Steven G. Harris
SVP Products, CloudBees
